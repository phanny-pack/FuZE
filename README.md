FuZE Lab ML implementation tests!

b_test file is an implementation of Anton Stepanov's code for a neural network to imitate and "memorize" the data given in hopes of creating easily diffrentiable equations from given discrete data read from sensors: in b_test, the test is on magnetic field strength at given intervals of space.
